In the line 50 I used pthread_join(tid[j], NULL )) so it can wait for each peocess
if(error = pthread_join(tid[j], NULL ))
{
    fprintf (stderr, "Fail to join thread %s\n.", strerror(error));
    return;
}
using a forloop that runs and join each process.

20 threads have been completed/joined successfully!

The way how I solve deadlock problem is bu using two while loops in pickupChopsticks function
using two whiloops that will hold the value while all the threads go trough, the thread will be
waiting for the choppstic to be available and then it will be using it. The chopstics will be available
and the thread will be free to continue with the process.

1. Albert Jasso (small).
We were working on how to pass the information in the structure, but since I did not use an 
structure, we just be sharing ideas.

2. I think everything is correct

3. Everithing showld be working fine, I run each program more than 100 times and there was no error or deadlocks.

4. the challenges past was to know what to use in order to be able to pass the informatin using threads, at the begining I was using a structure but then I use a global variable.
I thing this assigment is interesting enough, I spend some time making it.
