I have implemented part 3.

1. Alberto Jasso (medium).
   Mark Pena (medium).
   This assigment has being dificult overall, I had to do a lot of independent research, at the begining the indications were a little bit confusing but after the professor eplain us, it wasent that dificult.

2. Everithing is working fine and it should be correct. I provide a make file because I had problem compiling because I'm using math opperations and fore some reason include<math.h> was not compiling, so with the makefile that I  provide, it should be working OK.

EXTRA COMMENTS: the way to run the programs will be 

        ./a3p1 part1sequence            .............  for part 1
        ./a3p2 part2sequence            .............  for part 2
        ./a3p3 256 4096 1024 part2sequence  .........  for part 3

3. How I mention before, I use some math operations but math.h wasn't working for log so I provide a makefile that will compale everithing correct so please use the makefile prodvided. All outputsare showing correct at this point, just the second output for the 3th part is showing diferent.

4. I thing this assigment was a little bit complicated so I sudgest to provide more ditails in order to understand it better at the begining and don't have to wait for the professor's description
