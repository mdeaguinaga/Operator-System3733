We were discuting how to use dinamic alocation memory for this project, at the begining we want to use linked list, however we deside to use size_t and ssize_t.
Then the next point to discuse was how to get the information from the terminal and from the file.
We work as a team answering questions one from each other, I think we bering the a lot of healp to get this assigment done, since no one of did not know how to do the make file and had some complications with C programming language, we where giving and geting help.

2. Do you think everything you did is correct?
Yes, I think everithing on this program is correct, including follow the programming style guidelines, and SOLID prinsipals

3. If not, give a brief description of what is working and what progress was made on the part that is not working. 
n/a

4. Comments (e.g., what were the challenges, how to make this assignment more interesting etc.):
All this assigment was very challeng, since most of this staff we had to figure out how to do it.
This assignment will be more interesting if more details explanation were giving and if we had have a class (course) how to use some tools (MAKEFILES, DRIVERS, DEVOGERS, size_t, etc) first learn, then apply knowdlage.
